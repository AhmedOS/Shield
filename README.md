### Data Breach:

Using haveibeenpwned database and API, the user can check if his email account or password has been compromised in a data breach or not. The process of checking for a compromised passwords is very secure and it doesn't send your password or its hash over the air, instead, it uses only the first five characters of its SHA-1 hash for the checking process.

### Files Encryption:
This feature allows a user to encrypt a file using a password and decrypt it later using the same password.
The SHA256 hash of a password is used as a key for the AES algorithm. Also, 128 of 256 bits from the key are used as an initialization vector for the AES. Encrypted and decrypted files are saved on the user device.
